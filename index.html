				<p id = 'bio'>I'm a developer from atlantic Canada with a passion for the web and all of itâ€™s workings. I held a mouse before a crayon and had a laptop before a bike. In May of 2013 I purchased a Macbook and with the help of codeacademy.com learned python and HTML/CSS. Now experimenting with Javascript hoping to one make a job out of my passion for code and creating beautiful things. This is where I will collect all of my projects and web apps in one centralized page.</p>
